# areWhatsappChatting
<h2>Intro:</h2>
This is my little script to 'spy' on two people through Whatsapp.
It constantly check whether the two people that you chose in the target variables
are online at the same time.
If they are it will output the exact time it happened.

Be noted that the script saves localy the whole browsing session meaning you will need to log in for the script
only once and from then on, every time the script runs whatsapp web will be logged in.

<h4><i>Requirements:</i></h4>
1. Provide a path to the Chrome Selenium web driver file.</ br>
2. Provide a path to the output file.</ br>
3. Provide the names of the targets as they are shown in your Whatsapp.</ br>
4. Provide a path to the directory where the script will save the session (read the intro above).</ br>
5. Install Selenium library.</ br></ br>

Tested on Windows 10 and Fedora 26.
